                    If you are an adventure lover and love thrilling travel experience, then Illikal Kallu in Kottayam is one of the best destinations that you can explore. Said to be the
                    best destinations that you can explore. Said to be the highest peak in the Western Ghats, this peak is placed 3,400 ft above the sea level. You will have to trek a 3 kilometers distance to reach this beautiful destination.
                    Steep and winding road will take you to Illikal Kallu. Take it as a challenge and be ready to enjoy the most delightful part of Kerala. Illikal can be reached from Kottayam via Pala-Erattupeta- Thekkoya- Adukkom route. Earlier, it was not very easy to reach Illikal, but now, with the help of tourism department, it is easy to reach there even with a private vehicle.
                    Illikal Kallu consisst of three hills, each of which have peculiar shapes. Of which, one of the hill is known  as ‘Kuda Kallu’, which has the shape of a mushroom. This hill is famous for the presence of Neela Koduveli, the medicinal herb. Neela Koduveli is a blue colour ﬂower, which is believed to have  supernatural powers. The second hill is known as ‘Koonu Kallu’, with small hunch on sides. Another interesting thing you will ﬁnd here is the presence of a bridge, which is known as Narakapalam or Bridge to hell.
                    To reach the top of the hill, you will have to go through the bridge, narakapalam. But it is more adventurous and challenging as the narrow and slippery path may turn dangerous. You may feel the clouds are very closer to you and give a try to touch it with your ﬁngers. The small streams from the hill top, the cool climate, the breeze…wow it will be a different experience. The
                    the breeze…wow it will be a different experience. The romantic view of Arabian Sea and sunset from this hilltop is beyond the word of explanation.

                    Elaveezhapoonchira , a hill station which is  60 kms away  from Kottayam is gaining tourist importance. Elaveezhapoonchira means valley where leaves dont fall and is names so because the place has no trees. This is also one of the best places in Kerala to witness both the sun rise and sunset.
                    Locked between three beautiful hillocks Mankunnu, Kudayathoormala and Thonippara, Poonchira is a place of picturesque charm. Legends say that the pool here was a bathing place for Panchali the heroine of Mahabharata. The beautiful valleys of Poonchira spread across thousands of acres and the verdant landscape punctuated by the gigantic hills, is a unique feature of this land. During monsoon season, the water that gets accumulated over a wide area looks like a placid lake, reﬂecting the rain clouds and the majestic mountains. The pristine beauty of nature is preserved almost intact in this small region.
