                    Famous for its hills and mountains, Wayanad houses the Chembra peak amid the beautiful valleys and adventurous trekking trails. Although a bit of a dicey task, the trek to Chembra Peak is one of the most enjoyable experiences that tourists have encountered. It is the highest hill in Wayanad, and the day long trek is the best way to experience the wilderness that is this hill valley. Tourists are advised to carry sleeping bags, huts, canvases and trekking implements that are available at stores before the trek begins. After traversing through the backwoods, the breathtaking view of Wayanad greets one from the peak.
