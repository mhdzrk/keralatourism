                    The origins of the temple are mentioned in the ancient texts of the Hindu Puranas and it is considered to be the place where the Hindu deity Parasurama built a shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva as atonement after killing the Kshatriyas. The best time to visit the Vadakkunnathan Temple is during the festivities of Thrissur Pooram. Sadly non-Hindus are not allowed to enter the main temple.
