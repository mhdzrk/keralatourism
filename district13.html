                    If you visit Kannur and leave behind the historic Fort St. Angelos, then your visit is really incomplete. A gigantic fort located  3 km from Kannur , in triangular shape and built of laterite, Fort St. Angelos is also known as the  Kannur Fort and was built by the Portuguese in 1505. The credit of building the fort goes to the
                    in 1505. The credit of building the fort goes to the ﬁrst Portuguese Viceroy of India, Dom Francisco De Almeida.
                    The fort has seen many seizures and rules over the years. First, the Dutch captured it from the Portuguese rulers, then sold to the local ruler of Kannur, but later the British gained control over the fort and turned into one of their military stops in south India. Even today , it stands as a pride fort not showing any signs of its earlier conquests.
                    It is a protected monument today owing to its historical signiﬁcance and the Archaeological Survey of India has taken over the fort for its conservation. From the fort, you can get a great view of the surrounding ﬁshing bay and the sea.
