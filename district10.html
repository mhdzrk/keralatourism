                    Kadampuzha Bhagavathy temple is one of the major pilgrimage centres of Kerala and holds a unique distinction. There is no idol in the temple, perhaps one of the few such temples in India or the world. A legend goes that Adi Shankaracharya, the revered Hindu philosopher and teacher happened to pass around Kadampuzha which was a vast grassland then. As he walked along, he came across an invisible wall which he realised were Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati met, while the Lord was in the ‘Kirata’ form. It is believed that after Shankaracharya prayed to the Goddess, she appeared before him but disappeared into a small hole. He performed pooja there and later on the temple came to be built at the same place.
                    Even today , there is a hole which is believed to be the same spot where the Goddess disappeared and it is worshipped and hence no idol. Though the temple can be visited all around the year, it is during  N o v e m b e r - D e c e m b e r  that the temple festival is held. It is also one of the ecology promoting temples as plastic items are not allowed inside.
